TODO

list vector methods left:

	implement copy_backward

	insert
		1. insert single position
		2.
		3.
	erase
	relational operators

	https://www.boost.org/community/generic_programming.html

	read resize() documentation, through assignment or construction?
	look at tag dispatching
	iterator constructor: checks iterator_tags

	C++98 standard: look at every function and check construct vs assign differences

	Optimizations using example class, read the outputs of constructors etc and determine how the STL is optimized

NEXT:
	Implement the other required reimplementations
	Finish vector implementation
	Implement comparison operators and swap? (for vector)

	Clean up all vector methods and class, small functions etc

	Implement other containers

Iterators:

	https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/#:~:text=An%20iterator%20is%20any%20object,dereference%20(%20*%20)%20operators).
	for all properties that should be supported
