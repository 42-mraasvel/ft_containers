TODO

	Make list of all vector methods to implement
	Copy tests from cplusplus.com and put them in Catch
	Implement iterators
	Implement the other required reimplementations
	Implement utils
	Clean up all vector methods and class, small functions etc

	learncpp.com 8.x finish!
	read NF

REIMPLEMENT:

	iterators_traits
	reverse_iterator
	enable_if
	is_integral
	equal/lexicographical compare
	std::pair
	std::make_pair

Questions:

	Do you implement new iterators for each class, do you have a base class from which you derive iterators?
	Do you have to allocate at least 2 extra members in a vector, so that the iterator can point to the empty start/end, or can they point just beyond the memory area with no issues?

Iterators:

	https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/#:~:text=An%20iterator%20is%20any%20object,dereference%20(%20*%20)%20operators).
	for all properties that should be supported
